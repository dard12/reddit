          <div className="heading-2 faded">Fees, Payment, and Renewal</div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some of our Services are offered for a fee (“Paid Services”). By
              using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees.
              Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee,
              recurring fees, or revenue-based fee. For recurring fees, we’ll
              bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals
              (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis
              until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the
              relevant support team.
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated
              otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal,
              provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and
              services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force
              or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for
              payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our
              Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to
              pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are
              responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such
              Taxes.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid
              for or paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your
              access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit
              card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid
              Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.
            </li>
            <li>
              To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are
              automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid
              Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it
              will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or
              use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the
              then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). We may
              charge your account up to one month before the end of the
              subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you
              are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in
              order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of
              renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined
              automatically based on the date of the original purchase and
              cannot be changed.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for
              Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give
              you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the
              fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are
              issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by
              applicable law.
